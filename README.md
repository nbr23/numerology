## About
This is a small set of fun tools designed to play with numbers.
Based on a given string of digits, it will create all the possible combinations
of numbers, arrange them in all the imaginable ways, and try to add, substract,
multiply or divide each element composing the number in order to land on the
"Magic" number of which you want to prove the omnipresence.

## Usage

## Examples
This tool can be used for example to prove the omnipresence of the number 23 in
important dates, by simply feeding it a date (formated DDMMYY for example).
